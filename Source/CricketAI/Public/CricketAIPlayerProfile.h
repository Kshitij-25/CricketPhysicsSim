/**
 * CricketAIPlayerProfile — the DATA MODELS that give each AI player a cricketing
 * personality: how a batter scores and where they are vulnerable, what a bowler
 * does with the ball, and a captain's tactical leanings. The brains read these to
 * make believable, individual decisions (an opener grinds; a finisher swings; an
 * off-spinner attacks the left-hander's pads).
 *
 * These tendencies bias the brain's CHOICE only. They never touch the physics or
 * the laws — a "weakness against the short ball" makes the batter more likely to
 * choose a risky pull, it does not script an edge. The contact, the edge and the
 * dismissal still come from the shared physics/contest model.
 *
 * Every block derives sensibly from the existing FCricketPlayer rating, so the
 * shipped India/Australia rosters get rich AI behaviour with no extra authoring;
 * authored profiles (UCricketAIProfileDataAsset) override the derivation.
